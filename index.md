I am an Assistant Professor of "Data Science in Economics" at the [School of Business and Economics]([https://sew.unisg.ch/en](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-economics-and-social-sciences/subjects/school-of-business-and-economics/school-of-business-and-economics/business-and-economics/)) of the [University of Tübingen]([https://www.unisg.ch/](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/)).

My research interests are at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning to answer questions in empirical, mostly labor, economics. In particular I am currently working on the estimation of *average* and *heterogeneous* treatment effects as well as *policy learning*. See my [research section](https://mcknaus.github.io/menu/research.html) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=E604REwAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details.
